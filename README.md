# weather_app

My weather app.

## Start Projects
```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
If you want to run for web without debugging service
```
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8000
```

## Features
 - Search and save cities for weather data
 - Location based weather data

 You can test the app on [live demo](https://weatherapp-c1b34.web.app/) without auth.

 ## Known bugs
